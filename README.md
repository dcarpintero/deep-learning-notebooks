## 01. The Annotated Multi-Layer Perceptron

Build, Train, and Deploy a Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify handwritten Digits. It  implements from scratch the following modules: **linear layer**, **relu-activation-function**, **sequential-layer**, **flattening-layer**, **basic optimizer**, and **learner**. The model achieves 95.6% accuracy with `15 training epochs` and `batch size = 64`.

Experiment with different layer configurations, batch sizes, and training epochs. Understand the role of gradients, backpropagation, activation functions, flattening, and the importance of breaking simmetry with random parameter initialization.
