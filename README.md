## 01. Annotated Neural Network Classifier

This notebook implements in Python the essential modules required to build and train a multilayer perceptron that classifies garment images. In particular, it delves into the fundamentals of `approximation`, `non-linearity`, `regularization`, `gradients`, and `backpropagation`. Additionally, it explores the significance of `random parameter initialization` and the benefits of `training in mini-batches`.

By the end, you will be able to construct the building blocks of a neural network from scratch, understand how it learns, and deploy it to HuggingFace Spaces to classify real-world garment images.
